 *  Description:
 *  Although copy control is most often needed for classes that allocate
 *  resources, resource management is not the only reason why a class might need
 *  to define these members. Some classes have bookkeeping or other actions that
 *  the copy-control members must perform.
 *  As an example of a class that needs copy control in order to do some
 *  bookkeeping, weâ€™ll sketch out two classes that might be used in a
 *  mail-handling application.
 *  These classes, Message and Folder, represent, respectively, email
 *  (or other kinds of) messages, and directories in which a message might
 *  appear. Each Message can appear in multiple Folders. However, there will be
 *  only one copy of the contents of any given Message. That way, if the
 *  contents of a Message are changed, those changes will appear when we view
 *  that Message from any of its Folders.
 *
 *  Bugs:

 *  Expected result:
 *  --- You can write here the execution command & the expected result ---
