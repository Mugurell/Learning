**  Description:
**  Exercise 13.5: Given the following sketch of a class, write a copy con-
**  structor that copies all the members. Your constructor should dynamically
**  allocate a new string (ยง 12.1.2, p. 458) and copy the object to which ps
**  points, rather than copying ps itself.
**            class HasPtr {
**            public:
**              HasPtr(const std::string &s = std::string())
**                  : ps(new std::string(s)), i(0) { }
**            private:
**              std::string *ps;
**         
**            };
**  Exercise 13.8: Write the assignment operator for the HasPtr class from
**  exercise 13.5. As with the copy constructor, your assignment operator 
**  should copy the object to which ps points.
**  Exercise 13.11: Add a destructor to your HasPtr class from the previous
**  exercises.
**
**  Bugs:
**  --- None ---

**  TODO:
**  --- None ---  
**
**  Notes:
**  Usually declarations stays in headers and definitions in implementation
**  files (.cpp).
**  Inline is used normally when we want to indicate that some functions are to
**  be defined in the header.
**  When we declare and define some functions in the header, the declaration
**  should be repeated in the implementation file in which there are other
**  methods defined.
**  Following the rule of three/five, if we need a destructor (needed because
**  the synthesized destructor will not delete out *ps which points to a
**  dinamically allocated object) we usuallly also need copy constructor and
**  copy assignment operator. The other ule of thumb is that if a class needs
**  a constructor it almost surely needs a copy constructor as well. But if a
**  class needs a copy constructor/assignment operator it does not(necessarily)
**  indicate the need for a destructor.

// When an operator is a member function, the left-hand operand is bound to

// Best practice is for the assignement operator to return a reference to
// it's left-hand operand!
// Here we initialize new_ps to point to a string allocated on heap but which
// is a copy of the string contained in the received parameter. Hence, when the
// function ends and delete will be called on new_ps, it will not also delete
// the string contained by the argument, which may still be used in the caller.
