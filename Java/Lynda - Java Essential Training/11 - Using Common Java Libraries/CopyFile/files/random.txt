Before you set up Android Studio, be sure you have installed JDK 6 or higher
(the JRE alone is not sufficient)—JDK 7 is required when developing for
Android 5.0 and higher. To check if you have JDK installed (and which version),
open a terminal and type javac -version. If the JDK is not available or the
version is lower than 6, go download JDK.
