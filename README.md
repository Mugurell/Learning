### Exercises I've done on the road to becoming a programmer



Hi there!

Guess you've guessed my name is Mugurel.

This are my little programs from starting this amazing journey..
Journey to become a programmer :-)

So yea, maybe the exercises are not best organized, maybe they have some mistakes,
probably they could've been done better, but hey, I am a beginner. 
I try to learn, try do do mistakes and learn from them.

All in all, I am proud of them.

Maybe if you're also a beginner this can be helpful in some way?
